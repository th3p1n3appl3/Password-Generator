# Password-Generator

## Description

This project is designed to generate a password between 8 and 128 characters.

The user gets prompted to decide which type of characters he/she would like to include in the password.

I originally overread in the instructions that the password length is supposed to be also customisable for which I chose the implementation of a slide bar instead.
